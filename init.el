;; Emacs 24 init.el

;; NOTE: The name of the Org files is important!  When a file gets tangled,
;; it gets the same base name as the Org file.  Thus, tangling Emacs Lisp from
;; a file `init.org` would generate `init.el`, obliterating this file in the
;; process. So your config org file should not be named "init.org".

;; Initialize cask to get the correct version of org-mode

;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
